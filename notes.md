# Introduction
Data Mining / Machine Learning ( What really is the difference? )

Any non-random data set inevitably has patterns. From these patterns we can make generalizations about the data. From these generalizations we can make predictions. Often times you can make very good generalizations and thus make very good predictions.

2 Classes of predictions
1. Numeric ( Regression )
2. Discrete ( Classification )

- Given a person's height what would you predict their weight is?
- Given a person's height what sport would you predict they play? ( Basketball, Gymnastics, Track )

- Given the beat of a song, what year can we predict the song was recorded in? ( This is numeric since there is meaning for 2010.5 )

We can extract data from sources we never realized had data ( such as the audio rhythm of a song, and increasingly natural language and unstrutcutred text )

Since these predictions can be made with code, they can be handled by an application without human interpretation. For example a system can automatically recommend products etc...

What we are essentially doing is writing code that can extract meaning from data. Increasingly the definition for what can *be* data is increasing. Removing the bottleneck of manual interpretation of data. Which is often a bottleneck in many systems.

How is manual interpretation of data a bottleneck at DBC? ( In teaching web development )
One example I want to use, is debugging error messages.
- Error message displayed to the user
- User needs to determine what kind of error message it is
- User needs to remove application specific information in order to google it
- User needs to find relevant stack overflow solution or blog post

All of this is manual interpretation of data, but if we can do this through code we can build solutions that were previously impossible. *This* is really what I find so compelling.
